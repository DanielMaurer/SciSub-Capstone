# This code will be the backend support for the Sci-Sub project
'''
Goals for this code are to:
1. Contain methods for serial interaction with the Arduino
 - This will include different functions based on that instruments should be activated
   as well as how long data will be collected for
2. Contain methods to write sensor data to some sort of file
 - Previous models wrote to text files and parsed data by line
3. Contain methods to graph and analize data
 - Matplotlib has functionality to modify how the data is being presented, will
   utilize this
